  <h2> <i> types of malware</i></h2>

    
  <div class="malware"> 
    <h3> <i> Virusses </i></h3>
    <p class="ph4">  a computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and that is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code. In the process a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data.  </p>
  </div>


  <div class="malware"> 
    <h3> <i> Worms </i></h3>
    <p class="ph4"> A computer worm is a type of malicious software that travels through network connections all over the world to find its targets.
        Worms are so dangerous because they exploit known computer vulnerabilities (for example, a problem in a computer’s security system) to get inside a machine. Once it’s in there, it’s really hard to stop as it travels far and wide to find its target.
        Computer worms differ from computer viruses or other forms of malware in a couple of different ways </p>
  </div>
    
  <div class="malware"> 
    <h3> <i> Spyware </i></h3>
    <p class="ph4"> Spyware is a blanket term given to software that gathers information about your computer and the things you do on it, and sends that information over the Internet to a third party. Sometimes spyware asks for your consent first. More commonly, it installs itself on your computer without you knowing and runs in the background, secretly collecting data, sending you targeted adverts or meddling with your computer set-up </p>
  </div>
    
  <br>
    
  <div class="malware"> 
    <h3> <i> Adware </i></h3>
    <p class="ph4"> Adware is software that displays unwanted (and sometimes irritating) pop-up adverts which can appear on your computer or mobile device, it generates revenue for its developers by automatically generating adverts on your screen, usually within a web browser. Adware is typically created for computers but can also be found on mobile devices. Some forms of adware are highly manipulative and create an open door for malicious programs. </p>
  </div>


  <div class="malware"> 
    <h3> <i> Keyloggers </i></h3>
    <p class="ph4"> A keylogger (or keystroke logger) is a type of software or hardware used to track and record what someone types on their keyboard. Keyloggers can be used legally (some people even install them on their own devices), and you may have even used a computer with software installed to log keystrokes for monitoring and ensuring safe or approved use. 

But what keylogging means for everyday users is very different from what it means for cybercriminals. Malicious actors can also use them to capture your personal and financial information, PIN codes and account numbers, credit card numbers, usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data — all of which can be used to commit fraud or identity theft. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="malware"> 
    <h3> <i> Rootkit </i></h3>
    <p class="ph4"> Rootkits are a type of malware that are designed so that they can remain hidden on your computer. But while you might not notice them, they are active. Rootkits give cybercriminals the ability to remotely control your computer.

Rootkits can contain a number of tools, ranging from programs that allow hackers to steal your passwords to modules that make it easy for them to steal your credit card or online banking information. Rootkits can also give hackers the ability to subvert or disable security software and track the keys you tap on your keyword, making it easy for criminals to steal your personal information. </p>
  </div>

    
  <br>

  <div class="malware"> 
    <h3> <i> Ransomware </i></h3>
    <p class="ph4"> Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, that prevents you from accessing your computer files, systems, or networks and demands you pay a ransom for their return. Ransomware attacks can cause costly disruptions to operations and the loss of critical information and data.

You can unknowingly download ransomware onto a computer by opening an email attachment, clicking an ad, following a link, or even visiting a website that's embedded with malware.

Once the code is loaded on a computer, it will lock access to the computer itself or data and files stored there. More menacing versions can encrypt files and folders on local drives, attached drives, and even networked computers. </p>
  </div>
    
  <div class="malware"> 
    <h3> <i> Bots </i></h3>
    <p class="ph4"> Bots, or Internet robots, are also known as spiders, crawlers, and web bots. While they may be utilized to perform repetitive jobs, such as indexing a search engine, they often come in the form of malware. Malware bots are used to gain total control over a computer. Malicious bots are defined as self-propagating malware that infects its host and connects back to a central server(s). The server functions as a “command and control center” for a botnet, or a network of compromised computers and similar devices. Malicious bots have the “worm-like ability to self-propagate,” and can also:

Gather passwords
Log keystrokes
Obtain financial information
Relay spam
Capture and analyze packets
Launch DoS attacks
Open back doors on the infected computer
Exploit back doors opened by viruses and worms
Bots are usually used to infect large numbers of computers. These computers form a “botnet,” or a bot network.  </p>
  </div>
    
  <div class="malware"> 
    <h3> <i> Trojans </i></h3>
    <p class="ph4"> A Trojan horse, or Trojan, is a type of malicious code or software that looks legitimate but can take control of your computer. A Trojan is designed to damage, disrupt, steal, or in general inflict some other harmful action on your data or network. </p>
